# ItemChat

Introducing ItemChat - a user-friendly Minecraft plugin specially designed for Spigot 1.13 and later versions.
ItemChat aims to provide players with an efficient and secure method to exchange items and manage their inventories
while engaging in chat conversations.

One of the great challenges faced by Minecraft players is finding a convenient way to trade items with other players,
particularly during active chat interactions. Typing commands, searching for items, and managing inventories can quickly become
tedious and disrupt the flow of conversation. ItemChat has been developed to solve these issues by providing a simple and
intuitive way of exchanging items and maintaining your inventory without disrupting the chat experience.

This plugin was built non-exclusively for [InnocentBean](https://builtbybit.com/members/innocentbean.276962/) on builtbybit.com.
